# game_camel_koyalta
This repository contains the source code for a game about a camel from the Gobi Desert.
The game has been rewritten from the [**Atari**] platform (https://www.roug.org/retrocomputing/languages/basic/basicgames) into the Python programming language.
The **user1** folder contains the script to run and the game resources. 

To run, you must install and run the game from a shortcut on the desktop or from the application menu.
Or build a package for your Unix-like OS yourself.
For Windows/NT and GNU/Linux operating systems, the installation files can be found in [releases] (https://github.com/Panikowsky-M/camel-the-game/releases/tag/v0.1).
To run the web version, simply open the camel-web3.html file in the browser, or if you have a web server, place it in /var/www/html/index.html

The **c-port** folder contains a C file.
